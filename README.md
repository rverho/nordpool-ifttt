# Trigger Nordpool/Elspot price change events to your IFTTT Maker Channel
Gets day-ahead prices from [Nordpool](http://www.nordpoolspot.com/Market-data1/Elspot/)

## Installation
    git clone https://github.com/samuelmr/nordpool-ifttt
    cd nordpool-ifttt
    npm install
    cp config-sample.js config.js
    $EDITOR config.js

## Configuration
Configuration parameters:
- `area`: Set the area where you want to follow the prices. You can see
  Nordpool/Elspot areas at http://www.nordpoolspot.com/maps/
  Currently the active areas are BERGEN, DK1, DK2, EE, ELE, FRE, KR.SAND,
  KT, LT, LV, MOLDE, OSLO, SE, SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4, SYS, TR.HEIM and TROMSØ
- `currency`: Choose either `DKK`, `EUR`, `NOK` or `SEK`
- `currencySubUnit`: Name of 1/100 of your currency, e.g. `cents` for 'EUR'
  or `öre` for 'SEK'
- `highTreshold`: Set the price limit above which you want the high price
  event to be triggered. (Price is the price of a kWh in 1/100 of your
  selected `currency`. For example the value 6 means 6 cents/kWh if your
  `currency` is `EUR`.)
- `lowTreshold`: Set the price limit above which you want the low price
  event to be triggered.
- `maxHighHours`: If you use IFTTT to turn off heating when the energy price
  is high, you may want to limit the time your heating is off. If you set the
  `maxHighHours` to 3 and the energy price will be above your `highTreshold`
  for 7 hours, only the 3 most expensive consecutive hours will be triggered.
  Set to 24 if you want triggers for actual events.
- `maxLowHours`: Same as `maxHighHours` but for hours below `lowTreshold`.
  If you want to turn some appliances on when the price is lowest, but don't
  want or need to have them on for too long, setting `maxLowHours` to 2 will
  select the two cheapest hours from every cheap streak (consecutive hours
  when the price is below `lowTreshold`). Set to 24 if you don't need limits.
- `iftttKey`: Activate your IFTTT maker channel and get the key from
  https://ifttt.com/services/maker_webhooks/settings.
- `debugLevel`: Set to `0` to silence all console output. Increase to up to
  `4` in order to get more debugging information to the logs.
  Run `node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 logs "Nordpool IFTTT trigger"` to see the
  latest log entries.
